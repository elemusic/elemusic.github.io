		<h1>About</h1>
		<img id="matt-photo" src="assets/img/ele.jpg" alt="A Photo of Mateusz Dębski">
		<p>Hi! My name is Mateusz Dębski.</p>
		<p>I&#8217;ve been a fan of soundtracks and filmscores since I remember. But for many years I always wanted to not just be a passive listener; I wanted to compose.</p>
		<p>It wasn&#8217;t long until I decided to start writing my own cues under the name &#8220;Ele&#8221;.</p>
		<p>Using the modern, approachable technology I was able to transfer my thoughts and feelings into melodies and rhythms. </p>
		<p>Listening to my favorite composers helped me to understand how the <em>music</em> itself works and what makes it great, while working in radio helped me to understand how to mix, and how to produce your own music.</p>
		<p>I have privilege to live in a world where many things can inspire you. It can be a weather, it can be a walk in the night. It can be a painful breakup, or an awesome game/movie you just experienced. </p>
		<p>What you see (and what you will hopefully hear) is a result of those inspirations written in a recent years.</p>
		<p>I&#8217;m extremely proud of it and I will be very happy if you give it a listen or two.</p>
