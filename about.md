Hi! My name is Mateusz DÄ™bski.I've been a fan of soundtracks and filmscores since I remember. But for many years I always wanted to not just be a passive listener; I wanted to compose.It wasn't long until I decided to start writing my own cues under the name "Ele".Using the modern, approachable technology I was able to transfer my thoughts and feelings into melodies and rhythms. Listening to my favorite composers helped me to understand how the *music* itself works and what makes it great, while working in radio helped me to understand how to mix, and how to produce your own music.I have privilege to live in a world where many things can inspire you. It can be a weather, it can be a walk in the night. It can be a painful breakup, or an awesome game/movie you just experienced. What you see (and what you will hopefully hear) is a result of those inspirations written in a recent years.I'm extremely proud of it and I will be very happy if you give it a listen or two.
